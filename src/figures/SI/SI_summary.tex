\subsection{Robustness of Regime Signatures}
We verified that the mature regime signatures (bounded $AI$, zero drift, and confinement $|AI| \le 0.3$) are robust to methodological perturbations.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lag Selection:} The zero-drift signature remains stable across fixed lags $p \in \{1..6\}$ and AIC-selected lags, ensuring the equilibrium is not an artifact of model order (Figure SI-1).
    \item \textbf{Temporal Structure:} Observed confinement ratios are significantly higher than the aggregate mean of placebo models (linear shifts, circular permutations, block permutations; Wilcoxon $p < 7.8e-01$), confirming that the signatures depend on temporal alignment and are not reproduced under distribution-preserving or autocorrelation-preserving placebos at the same observational scale (Figure SI-2).
    \item \textbf{Control Variables:} Residualizing activity and structure against team size and activity level preserves the confinement signal (Spearman correlation between raw and conditional confinement $r = 0.04$), suggesting the signatures are not reducible to these confounds at the chosen observational scale (Figure SI-3).
\end{itemize}
